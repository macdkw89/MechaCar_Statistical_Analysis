## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![summary](/images/summary.png)

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

As the above screenshot can show, the vehicle_length and ground_clearance have a significant non-random amount of variance when compared to the mpg values.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is NOT considered to be zero since the p-value (5.35e-11) is much smaller than the significance level (0.05).

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

We believe the model accurately predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes because the R-Squared value is 0.7149.
